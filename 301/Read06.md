# NODE.JS

**An Introduction to Node.js**

1. What is node.js?
   
  - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime 
    environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside 
    a web browser.

2.  what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

  - V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine,
    written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements
    ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux 
    systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be
    embedded into any C++ application.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

  - environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” 
    approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on
    waiting for I/O requests to return.

4. What is npm?

  - NPM is a package manager for Node. js packages, or modules if you like. www.npmjs.com
    hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

  - v12.21.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

  - '6.14.11'

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

  - npm install -g jshint

8. What is node used for?

  - Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded
    nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with 
    real-time, push-based architectures in mind.



**6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

  - Greater efficiency.
  - Engaged collaboration.
  - Learning from fellow students.
  - Social skills.
  - Job interview readiness.
  - Work environment readiness.

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

  -  Greater efficiency.

3. How does pair programming work?

  - Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work 
    together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or 
    navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
