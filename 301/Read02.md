# State and Props

- the ‘render’ happens befor the componentDidMount.

- the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is the *constructor*.

1. constructor
2. render
3. React Updates
4. componentDidMount
5. componentWillUnmount

- What does componentDidMount do? it is the best place to make API calls since, at 
  this point, the component has been mounted and is available to the DOM.

## Things I want to know more about

- I  would like to expand my knowledge on everything about the React.
