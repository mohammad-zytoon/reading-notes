**Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack**

1. What is a ‘call’?

  - is a predefined JavaScript method. It can be used to invoke (call)
    a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter). With 
    call() , an object can use a method belonging to another object.


2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

  - he JS setTimeout() method will call a function after the time specified 
   in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 second) has passed. The specified function will
   be executed once. If you need to run a function multiple times, use the setInterval() method.


3. What does LIFO mean?

  - Last in, first out (LIFO) is a method used to account for inventory.
    Under LIFO, the costs of the most recent products purchased (or produced) 
    are the first to be expensed.


4. What causes a Stack Overflow?

  - The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which 
    a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information 
    associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.





**JavaScript error messages**


1. What is a ‘refrence error’?

  - The ReferenceError object represents an error when a non-existent variable is referenced.


2. What is a ‘syntax error’?

  - Syntax errors are mistakes in using the language


3. What is a ‘range error’?

  - is thrown when trying to pass a number as an argument to a function that does not 
    allow a range that includes that number. 


4. What is a ‘tyep error’?

  - represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively)
    when a value is not of the expected type.


5. What is a breakpoint?

  - is a signal that tells the debugger to temporarily suspend execution of your program 
    at a certain point in the code. 


6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

  - s the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors.
