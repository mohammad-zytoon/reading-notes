# Introduction to React and Components

## **component**

- Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual     functional or logical components.

-  that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties.


## **props**

- “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

- But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow.

- Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
