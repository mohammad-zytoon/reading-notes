# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

**Functional Programming Concepts**


1.  What is functional programming?

  - is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding
    shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.


2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  - is a function which: Given the same input, will always return the same output.
    Produces no side effects.


3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

  - they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if 
    you pass in the same arguments.


4. What is immutability?

  - is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.


5. What is Referential transparency?

  - property of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be .




**Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()**

1. What is a module?

  -  is one which acts like a mathematical function; given the same inputs, it
     will always produce the same outputs. It implies that the state passed in is
     not modified, and that the function has no state of its own.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

  - to order or demand something, or to order someone to do something, esp. because of 
    a rule or law: [ + to infinitive ] We're required to check your identification before letting you in.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

  - Save this code in a file named mymodule.py. 
  - Import the module named mymodule, and call the greeting function.
  - Save this code in the file mymodule.py. 
  - Import the module named mymodule, and access the person1 dictionary.


4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

  - After we create and then publish a discussion, you can enable the discussion tab 
    for students by going to course settings –> Module, and clicking “enable” on the 
    wheel next to the module tab. This will make the tab visible to students.
