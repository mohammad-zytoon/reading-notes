Choosing a text editor is a personal matter, but  most of the text editors are very similar, so you should search for the following properties in the text editor that we will use:
1. code completion.
2. syntax highlighting
 3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue) 
 4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

Below are some recommended programs for use: Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text.

The command line:

The advanteges of command line is: as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time. We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us.

Opening a terminal is easy proces for example in my case i am using windows so i will need SSH client the rather good one is Putty.the shell:  is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you and the most common one is bash.

Basic Navigation part contain number of commands we used in terminal such as:
pwd: It telling us what our current or present working directory is. 
LS: it listing the directories and the files.
cd: we using it to  move around in the system 
also we learn two concepts:
Relative path: a file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
Absolute path: a file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

 

In file part we learn the following :
File: command obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
ls -a: List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
