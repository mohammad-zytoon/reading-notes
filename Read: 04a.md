JavaScript is working to add vitality to the sites that we design by entering them and 
modifying them use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page, using JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them, also it can be used to  specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page also it can make the web react to reactions. 

Examples of javascript in the browser:

 -showing slides and there is extra options also.
 -Validating forms and its extra options.
 -Reloading part of the page.
 -Filtering data.
 
key concepts in computer programming for the java users:

-A: what is ascript and how do i create one?
-B: how do computers fit in with the world around them?
-C: how do i write a script for a web page?

Script: is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To write a script, we need to first
state our goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

Designing ascript steps:

1: DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.
3: CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

-we can summerising the script by drwing it in a flowchart.


Expression: evaluates into (results in) a single value.

expression types: 
1-expressions that just assign a value to a variable:(var color = 'beige'; )
2-expressions that use two or more values to return a single value:(var area = 3 * 2;)

OPERATORS:Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.
-ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: Assign a value to a variable color = 'beige'; 
-ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: Perform basic math area = 3 * 2; 
-STRING OPERATORS: Combine two strings greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly'; 
-COMPARISON OPERATORS: Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se buy = 3 > 5;
-LOGICAL OPERATORS: Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

Mathematical operators:
-ADDITION + Adds one value to another.
-SUBTRACTION Subtracts one value from another.
-DIVISION I Divides two values.
-MULTIPLICATION * Multiplies two values using an asterisk
-INCREMENT + + Adds one to the current number.

-There is just one string operator: the+ symbol it is used to join the strings on either side of it.
