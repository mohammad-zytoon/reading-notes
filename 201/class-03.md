## *Chapter 3: Lists*

### **HTML lists types:**

- **Ordered** lists are lists where each item in the list is
  numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
  a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
  where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

  -<ol> The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.
 
  -<li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag
        and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)
  
-**Unordered** lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
 (rather than characters that indicate order).

  -<ul> The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
  
  -<li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag
        and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)

-**Definition** lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
 definitions for each of those terms.

 -<dl> The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually 
       consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
       Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.
 
 -<dt> This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
 -<dd> This is used to contain the definition.

-**Nested Lists:** You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist
               or nested list.

*Chapter-13-Boxes*

-We can set several properties that affect the appearance of
 these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:

  -Control the dimensions of your boxes.
  -Create borders around boxes.
  -Set margins and padding for boxes.
  -Show and hide boxes.

 -Box Dimensions(width, height)
 -Limiting Width(min-width, max-width)
 -Limiting Height(min-height, max-height)
 -Overflowing Content (overflow, hidden, scroll)
 -Border, Ma rgin & Padding.
 -White spa ce & Vertical Ma rgin.
 

# **From the Duckett JS book:**
 
 ## *Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions*

  -An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
   just store one value; it stores a list of values.

  -Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
   a numbered list. It is important to know that the
   numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

  
  ## *Chapter-4-Decisions and Loops from switch statements on*
  
   -Conditional statements allow your code to make
     decisions about what to do next.

   -Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
     are used to compare two operands.

   -Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
    set of comparison operators.

   -if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
     if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

   -switch statements allow you to compare a value
     against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
     option if none match).

   -Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
   
   -All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
   
   -There are three types of loop: for, while, and
     do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
