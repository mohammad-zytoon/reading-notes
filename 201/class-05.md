### *Chapter-5-Images*

-Choosing Images for Your Si te, A picture can say a thousand words,
 and great images help make the difference between anaverage-looking
 site and a really engaging one.

-Storing Images on Your Site:If you are building a site from scratch, 
 it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

### **Adding Images:**

-<img>:(To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty
 element (which means there is no closing tag).

-Height & Width of Images:(You will also often see an <img> element use two other 
 attributes that specify its size).

-Where to Place Images in Your Code:
  
  1: before a paragraph.
  2: inside the start of a paragraph.
  3:in the middle of a paragraph.

-Three Rules for Creating Images:
 1:Save images in the right format.
 2:Save images at the right size.
 3:Use the correct resolution.

-Tools to Edit & Save Images:There are several tools you can use to edit and
 save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution.

-Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat 
 colors are better saved as GIFs.


### *Chapter-11-Color*

-Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
 convey the mood and evokes reactions.

-There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
 RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

-Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

-It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
 between any text and the background color (otherwise
 people will not be able to read your content).

-CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
 indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

-CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
 with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


### *Chapter-12-Text*

-There are properties to control t XX he choice of font, size,
 weight, style, and spacing.

-There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
 most people will have installed.

-If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
 several options, but you need to have the right license
 to use them.

-You can control the space between lines of text,
 individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
 to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

-You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
 element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
 when they have visited a link.


## **JPEG vs PNG vs GIF — which image format to use and when?**

 ### **TL;DR:**
 
 -**JPEG:**used for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation
       in colour and intensity is smooth.
 -**PNG:**used format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects 
      with sharp contrast edges like logos.
 -**GIF:**used for format for images that contain animations.

 ### **Compression:**
             Almost all forms of data that we see on the internet — text, image, video etc. — are compressed 
             to reduce the size of data and ensure faster transmission.

-**Compression types:**
 -lossless.
 -lossy.

 ### **Transparency:**
    In a simple form, transparency indicates something that is completely invisible.
 
 -**JPEG:** images don’t support transparency and are hence not usable for such cases.
 -**PNG:**  images support transparency in two ways:(inserting an alpha channel that allows partial transparency 
        or by declaring a single colour as transparent).

 -**GIF:**  images support transparency by declaring a single colour in the colour palette as transparent.

 ### **Colours:**
  There is a significant difference in the number of colours that can be supported by these 3 formats.

 -**JPEG:** images can support around 16 million colours. This is what makes them suitable for 
        storing images of natural scenes.
 -**PNG:** images mainly have two modes — PNG8 and PNG24. PNG8 can support upto 256 colours 
       whereas PNG24 can handle upto 16 million colours like a JPEG image.
 
 ### **Animation:**
          Animation, in this case, refers to any change or movement in the image. It doesn’t necessarily have 
          to have frame rates like an animated video, but essentially a part or the entire image changes with time.
