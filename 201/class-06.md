## **Chapter-3-Object Literals**

-Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
 of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables
 and functions take on new names.

-*IN AN OBJECT:* VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES: If a variable is part of an object, it is called a  property. Properties te ll us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
 Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different number of rooms.

-*IN AN OBJECT:* FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS: If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.
 Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. For example, you can check how many
 rooms are available by subtracting the number of booked rooms from the total number of rooms.

-This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one method. The object is in curly braces. It is 
 stored in a variable called hotel .

-Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a va lue. In an object,
 that name is called a key.

-An object cannot have two keys with the same name. This is because keys are used to access
 their corresponding values.

-The value of a property can be a st ring, number, Boolean, array, or even another object. The va lue of a
 method is always a function.

-An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.

-In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

-Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the
 browser window.


## **Chapter-5-Document Object Model**

 -The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
 
 -DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
  element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

 -You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
  attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

 -Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
  node, it will always return a Nadelist.

 -From an element node, you can access and update its 
  content using properties such as textContent and
  i nner HTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

 -An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
  child elements that are siblings of each other.

 -In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
  inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).

 -Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
