# **From the Duckett HTML book:**

## *Ch-4-Links*

-Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from
 one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

-Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
 between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
 which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

-Linking to Other Sites:

-<a>: other-sites.html HTML Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute
      called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that
      you want people to go to when they click on the link.

-Linking to Other Pages on the Sa me Site:
  
 <a>:When you are linking to other pages within the same site,
     you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You
     can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

-Rela tive UR Ls:
 Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
 website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

-Email Links:mailto: email-links.html HTML To create a link that starts up
 the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address,
 you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts
 with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the
 email to be sent to.

-target: If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening
         <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

-Linking to a Sp ecific Part of the Sa me Page:
 At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the
 corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way down the
 page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.


## *Chapter-15-Layout*

-<div> elements are often used as containing elements
 to group together sections of a page.

-Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
 specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

-The float property moves content to the left or right
 of the page and can be used to create multi-column
 layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

-Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

-Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
 and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

-Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

-You can include multiple CSS files in one page.


## *Chapter-3-Functions, Methods, and Objects*

-Functions allow you to group a set of related
 statements together that represent a single task.

-Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
 to do their job) and may return a value.

-An object is a series of variables and functions that
 represent something from the world around you.

-In an object, variables are known as properties of the
 object; functions are known as methods of the object.

-6 Reasons for Pair Programming:

 How does pair programming work?

 -While there are many different styles, pair programming 
  commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 

  ## *Why pair program?*

 -While learning to code, developers likely study several 
  programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class,
  there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a 
  new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
  Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: 
  understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing
  from scratch a meaningful.

 **pair program advantages:**

 1-Greater efficiency.
 2-Engaged collaboration.
 3-Learning from fellow students.
 4-Social skills.
 5-Job interview readiness.
 6-Job interview readiness.
